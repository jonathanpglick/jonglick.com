![Jon Glick's Photo](jon-glick.jpg?cropResize=400,200){.pull-right} I make
things for the internet using tools appropriate for the job. I've used a huge
range of technologies, libraries and frameworks as well as writing a few of my
own.

I currently focus on Javascript and Python and, although they're not truly
functional, I've enjoyed and benefitted from bringing functional programming
techniquies into my everyday work. My front-end experience involves everything
from taking wireframes and mockups to HTML/CSS to implementing full single page
javascript applications backed by data APIs. On the back-end I've build
large-scale content management systems (CMS), applications, API & e-commerce
integrations and more. I once even built an FFmpeg-powered video editor in PHP.

Want some jargon? Here's a small sample of the jargon I've built things with
professionally:

Javascript (ECMA Script), Python, PHP, Ruby, React, Redux, Git, Mercurial,
AngularJS, LESS, SASS, MySQL, PostreSQL, MongoDB, Drupal 6, Drupal 7, PDF
generation, Django, Rails, Symfony, Zend Framework, Middleman, Jekyll, Content
Management Systems (CMS), Learning Management Systems (LMS), Dojo Toolkit,
Backbone, Fabric, ExtJS, Canvas, jQuery, jQuery Mobile, Stripe, Apache Solr,
FFmpeg, Leaflet, OEmbed, AWS, CoffeeScript, Gulp, SalesForce API, Functional
Programming (FP), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Bootstrap
